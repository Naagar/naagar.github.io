      In the domain of art restoration, develop an innovative computer vision
      model capable of effectively restoring deteriorated images of art pieces. The goal is to create
      an automated solution that can enhance and reconstruct degraded artworks, improving their
      visual quality while preserving their original characteristics. The model should handle a
      diverse range of deterioration types, including but not limited to noise, blur, scratches, fading,
      and other common forms of degradation.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me (Note:update in progress, visit researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~sandeep.nagar)

Hi! I am a final year PhD student under the guidance of prof. Girish Varma at Machine Learning Lab, IIIT-Hyderabad, India. Previously, I have completed research internships at Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratory, University of Illinois, under the guidance of prof. Narendra Ahuja in collaboration with Dr David Beiser and Dr David Chestekat at College of Medicine at University of Illinois Chicago . I have also completed a research internship at School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales Sydney, under the guidance of Prof Rohitash Chandra and Dr. Ehsan Farahbakhsh in collaberation with School of Geosciences, The University of Sydney, Australia.

I hold a Btech degree in Computer Science Engineering from Harcourt Butler Technical University, Kanpur, India. I am from Greater Noida, India. I am passionate about creating and building ML ideas. My main research interests include Computer Vision, Robotics, Theoretical Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

I also read novels, find a list of interesting books here [goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48728408-sandeep-nagar?ref=nav_mybooks).
