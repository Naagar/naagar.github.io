## About Me

Hi!  I am a final-year PhD student at [Machine Learning Lab](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/), India, under the guidance of [Prof. Girish Varma](https://girishvarma.in/). My research primarily focuses on Probabilistic Generative Models (Normalizing Flows), Theoretical Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, with applications in Computer Vision.

I have industry experience from my semester at Samsung Research, where I worked with [Dr. Sathya Reddy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=My9GRC0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Pravin Nair](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/faculty/profile/pravinnair) on Generative Models for Image Super-Resolution. Additionally, I have completed research internships at:
- [CVR Lab](https://vision.ai.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois, under the guidance of Prof. [Narendra Ahuja](https://vision.ai.illinois.edu/narendra-ahuja/) in collaboration with Dr. David Beiser and Dr. David Chestekat at the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois, Chicago.
- School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, under the guidance of Prof. [Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra) and Dr. Ehsan Farahbakhsh in collaboration with the School of Geosciences, The University of Sydney, Australia.

I hold a B.Tech degree in Computer Science \& Engineering from [Harcourt Butler Technical University - Kanpur](https://hbtu.ac.in/), India. I am from [Greater Noida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Noida), India. Beyond research, I am passionate about building and developing innovative ML solutions. I am also an avid reader; feel free to check out my collection of intriguing novels on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/48728408-sandeep-nagar?ref=nav_mybooks).
