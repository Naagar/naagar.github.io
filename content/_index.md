  #       I focus on **probabilistic generative models**, particularly **normalizing flows** and their theoretical foundations. My work includes developing **efficient invertible convolutional networks** for generative modeling, with applications in **molecular design, image generation, and medical imaging**. I aim to create **interpretable, computationally efficient models** that bridge theoretical innovations with real-world applications in **computer vision, healthcare, and science**.
